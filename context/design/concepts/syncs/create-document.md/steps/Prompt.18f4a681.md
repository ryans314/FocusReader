# Prompt: Why are you still not getting this right. Perhaps you are overthinking this. All the createDocument flow needs to do is use sessions, and when a user calls createDocument, just create the document, register the document, and create the textSettings for the document. It should be very simple. Please do what you need to to make it work, but right now it doesn't. Start again from the beginning and make it from scratch.
