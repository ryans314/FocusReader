# Prompt: No. I do not want you to try to solve the problem, I want you to answer my question. I am trying to understand the code. Why does it use `library: clientLibraryId` instead of `library: library` or `library: userLibrary._id`? I know those don't work, but why don't they? I don't see clientLibraryId in the frame, so how does the then clause have access to it?
