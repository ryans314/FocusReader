# Prompt: nope, still getting an error. Please carefully reconsider the whole sync (for RemoveDocumentRequest) to ensure that it is structured correctly, and consider ways to restructure the then clause. Here is the error:

```
Type '($: any) => { library: any; document: any; }' is not assignable to type 'Mapping'.  
Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type '($: any) => { library: any; document: any; }'.deno-ts(2322)
```
