# Prompt: For the following routes, can you make syncs for verification? Only the action itself needs to happen, but it should require that the user verifies with the session. The syncs should also be in the same file. Please repeat my prompt to me so I know you are answering the right question.

```
"/api/FocusStats/removeSession",

  "/api/FocusStats/_viewStats",

  "/api/FocusStats/_getSessions",

  "/api/Library/removeDocument",

  "/api/Profile/deleteAccount",

  "/api/Profile/changePassword",

  "/api/Profile/_getUserDetails",
```
