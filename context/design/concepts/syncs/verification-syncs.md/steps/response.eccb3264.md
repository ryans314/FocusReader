# response:

Of course. Here are the synchronizations for the routes you listed, implemented to verify a user's session before executing the corresponding action or query.

**Prompt:** For the following routes, can you make syncs for verification? Only the action itself needs to happen, but it should require that the user verifies with the session. The syncs should also be in the same file.

* `/api/FocusStats/removeSession`
* `/api/FocusStats/_viewStats`
* `/api/FocusStats/_getSessions`
* `/api/Library/removeDocument`
* `/api/Profile/deleteAccount`
* `/api/Profile/changePassword`
* `/api/Profile/_getUserDetails`
