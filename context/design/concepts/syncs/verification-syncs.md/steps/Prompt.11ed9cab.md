# Prompt: it seems stats is working as intended,  but getSessions is returning this (raw json): `{"sessions":[{"sessionData":{"_id":"019a6ffd-a946-7d9c-a29b-a48b17f9512a","user":"019a6ffd-6680-716f-bc12-805373273757","document":"019a6ffd-9c5d-722a-864f-4bd8375bed1d","startTime":"2025-11-10T22:58:06.278Z","endTime":"2025-11-10T22:58:10.884Z"}},{"sessionData":{"_id":"019a6ffd-cd71-783b-afce-a8ecab3277c1","user":"019a6ffd-6680-716f-bc12-805373273757","document":"019a6ffd-9c5d-722a-864f-4bd8375bed1d","startTime":"2025-11-10T22:58:15.537Z","endTime":"2025-11-10T22:58:19.945Z"}}]}` I'm not sure if that's intended,  but it renders wrong on the front end. Can you make sure it matches the API spec that you created for it?
